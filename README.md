Parallel-Computing-Java-
========================

This repository contains all the programs that are a part of my Parallel Computing Course. 
Every folder inside this repo is a separate project.

Every project has a sequential and a parallel implementation of the same program. 
Parallel Java 2 library is used in each of the programs.
